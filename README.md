1. Prediction using Supervised ML - Linear regression has been used to analyze the given and dataset and predict values.
2. Prediction using Unsupervised ML - K-Means algorithm has been used to analyze given dataset and visualize results.
3. Prediction using Decision Tree - Same dataset as above has been analyzsed using decision tree classifier.

I would like to thank Spark foundation for providing this opportunity.
